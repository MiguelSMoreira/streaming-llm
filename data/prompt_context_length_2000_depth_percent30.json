Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house\non a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on\nthe island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,\nyou've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will\nhave more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?\nThat's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yourself\npacking a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and\nthink about that.For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a\npen.There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,\nor tea, but I can live without them.  I'm not so addicted to caffeine\nthat I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for a\nweekend.Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to\ntake earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  If\nanywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person in\nthe next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?\n(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum on\nsome project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay or\ndebug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of the\nnoise is whitish.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming\nthrough the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting\nsomething new, that requires complete quiet.   You never\nknow when this will strike. It's just as well to carry plugs.The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Though\nactually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that\ntheir main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever go\nback and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It's just that if\nI can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets\nin the way of having the next.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.\nI use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.\nThe secret to writing on such\nnarrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like\na Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,\npartly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and\npartly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Before\nthat I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problem\nwith scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  In a notebook\nyou can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages\naround it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd\nwritten years before that might say something I needed to remember,\nif I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to\nread.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of\nthem, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringing\nbooks is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good\u2014that what\nI need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips are\noften quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned\nreading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.\nI bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able\nto slip into another distilled by some writer.  It's like eating\njam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books.  I was walking in\nsome steep mountains once, and decided I'd ra"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ther just think, if I\nwas bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn't\nso bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead\nof reading other people's.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts\nto taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  They're\ngoing to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2008, rev. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies\nweren't designed to eat the foods that people in rich countries eat, or\nto get so little exercise.  \nThere may be a similar problem with the way we work: \na normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour\nor sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working \nwith startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've\nnoticed a definite difference between programmers working on their\nown startups and those working for large organizations.\nI wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;\nstarting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put\nit is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is\nhappier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating\ndoughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be\nworking in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that\nI'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they\nseemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times\nmore alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working\nfor oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living\nin the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.\nLife in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed\nfor.\nTreesWhat's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of\nthe problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large\ngroups.Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that\neach species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas\nmight have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans\nalso seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about\nhunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own\nexperience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8\nwork well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50\nis really unwieldy.\n[1]\nWhatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in\ngroups of several hundred.  And yet\u2014for reasons having more\nto do with technology than human nature\u2014a great many people\nwork for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide\nthemselves into units small enough to work together.  But to\ncoordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your\nboss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when\nyou use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,\nsomething strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention\nexplicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss\nrepresents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely\na group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really\na group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work\ntogether as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group\nworking for each manager would have to work as if they were a single\nperson\u2014the workers and manager would each share only one\nperson's worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were\none person.
