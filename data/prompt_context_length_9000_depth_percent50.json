Keep your response short and direct"}, {"role": "user", "content": "July 2006I've discovered a handy test for figuring out what you're addicted\nto.  Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend's house\non a little island off the coast of Maine.  There are no shops on\nthe island and you won't be able to leave while you're there.  Also,\nyou've never been to this house before, so you can't assume it will\nhave more than any house might.What, besides clothes and toiletries, do you make a point of packing?\nThat's what you're addicted to.  For example, if you find yourself\npacking a bottle of vodka (just in case), you may want to stop and\nthink about that.For me the list is four things: books, earplugs, a notebook, and a\npen.There are other things I might bring if I thought of it, like music,\nor tea, but I can live without them.  I'm not so addicted to caffeine\nthat I wouldn't risk the house not having any tea, just for a\nweekend.Quiet is another matter.  I realize it seems a bit eccentric to\ntake earplugs on a trip to an island off the coast of Maine.  If\nanywhere should be quiet, that should.  But what if the person in\nthe next room snored?  What if there was a kid playing basketball?\n(Thump, thump, thump... thump.)  Why risk it?  Earplugs are small.Sometimes I can think with noise.  If I already have momentum on\nsome project, I can work in noisy places.  I can edit an essay or\ndebug code in an airport.  But airports are not so bad: most of the\nnoise is whitish.  I couldn't work with the sound of a sitcom coming\nthrough the wall, or a car in the street playing thump-thump music.And of course there's another kind of thinking, when you're starting\nsomething new, that requires complete quiet.   You never\nknow when this will strike. It's just as well to carry plugs.The notebook and pen are professional equipment, as it were.  Though\nactually there is something druglike about them, in the sense that\ntheir main purpose is to make me feel better.  I hardly ever go\nback and read stuff I write down in notebooks.  It's just that if\nI can't write things down, worrying about remembering one idea gets\nin the way of having the next.  Pen and paper wick ideas.The best notebooks I've found are made by a company called Miquelrius.\nI use their smallest size, which is about 2.5 x 4 in.\nThe secret to writing on such\nnarrow pages is to break words only when you run out of space, like\na Latin inscription.  I use the cheapest plastic Bic ballpoints,\npartly because their gluey ink doesn't seep through pages, and\npartly so I don't worry about losing them.I only started carrying a notebook about three years ago.  Before\nthat I used whatever scraps of paper I could find.  But the problem\nwith scraps of paper is that they're not ordered.  In a notebook\nyou can guess what a scribble means by looking at the pages\naround it.  In the scrap era I was constantly finding notes I'd\nwritten years before that might say something I needed to remember,\nif I could only figure out what.As for books, I know the house would probably have something to\nread.  On the average trip I bring four books and only read one of\nthem, because I find new books to read en route.  Really bringing\nbooks is insurance.I realize this dependence on books is not entirely good\u2014that what\nI need them for is distraction.  The books I bring on trips are\noften quite virtuous, the sort of stuff that might be assigned\nreading in a college class.  But I know my motives aren't virtuous.\nI bring books because if the world gets boring I need to be able\nto slip into another distilled by some writer.  It's like eating\njam when you know you should be eating fruit.There is a point where I'll do without books.  I was walking in\nsome steep mountains once, and decided I'd rather just think, if I\nwas bored, rather than carry a single unnecessary ounce.  It wasn't\nso bad.  I found I could entertain myself by having ideas instead\nof reading other people's.  If you stop eating jam, fruit starts\nto taste better.So maybe I'll try not bringing books on some future trip.  They're\ngoing to have to pry the plugs out of my cold, dead ears, however.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nMarch 2008, rev. June 2008Technology tends to separate normal from natural.  Our bodies\nweren't designed to eat the food"}, {"role": "user", "content": "s that people in rich countries eat, or\nto get so little exercise.  \nThere may be a similar problem with the way we work: \na normal job may be as bad for us intellectually as white flour\nor sugar is for us physically.I began to suspect this after spending several years working \nwith startup founders.  I've now worked with over 200 of them, and I've\nnoticed a definite difference between programmers working on their\nown startups and those working for large organizations.\nI wouldn't say founders seem happier, necessarily;\nstarting a startup can be very stressful. Maybe the best way to put\nit is to say that they're happier in the sense that your body is\nhappier during a long run than sitting on a sofa eating\ndoughnuts.Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be\nworking in a way that's more natural for humans.I was in Africa last year and saw a lot of animals in the wild that\nI'd only seen in zoos before. It was remarkable how different they\nseemed. Particularly lions. Lions in the wild seem about ten times\nmore alive. They're like different animals. I suspect that working\nfor oneself feels better to humans in much the same way that living\nin the wild must feel better to a wide-ranging predator like a lion.\nLife in a zoo is easier, but it isn't the life they were designed\nfor.\nTreesWhat's so unnatural about working for a big company?  The root of\nthe problem is that humans weren't meant to work in such large\ngroups.Another thing you notice when you see animals in the wild is that\neach species thrives in groups of a certain size.  A herd of impalas\nmight have 100 adults; baboons maybe 20; lions rarely 10.  Humans\nalso seem designed to work in groups, and what I've read about\nhunter-gatherers accords with research on organizations and my own\nexperience to suggest roughly what the ideal size is: groups of 8\nwork well; by 20 they're getting hard to manage; and a group of 50\nis really unwieldy.\n[1]\nWhatever the upper limit is, we are clearly not meant to work in\ngroups of several hundred.  And yet\u2014for reasons having more\nto do with technology than human nature\u2014a great many people\nwork for companies with hundreds or thousands of employees.Companies know groups that large wouldn't work, so they divide\nthemselves into units small enough to work together.  But to\ncoordinate these they have to introduce something new: bosses.These smaller groups are always arranged in a tree structure.  Your\nboss is the point where your group attaches to the tree.  But when\nyou use this trick for dividing a large group into smaller ones,\nsomething strange happens that I've never heard anyone mention\nexplicitly.  In the group one level up from yours, your boss\nrepresents your entire group.  A group of 10 managers is not merely\na group of 10 people working together in the usual way.  It's really\na group of groups.  Which means for a group of 10 managers to work\ntogether as if they were simply a group of 10 individuals, the group\nworking for each manager would have to work as if they were a single\nperson\u2014the workers and manager would each share only one\nperson's worth of freedom between them.In practice a group of people are never able to act as if they were\none person.  But in a large organization divided into groups in\nthis way, the pressure is always in that direction.  Each group\ntries its best to work as if it were the small group of individuals\nthat humans were designed to work in.  That was the point of creating\nit.  And when you propagate that constraint, the result is that\neach person gets freedom of action in inverse proportion to the\nsize of the entire tree.\n[2]Anyone who's worked for a large organization has felt this.  You\ncan feel the difference between working for a company with 100\nemployees and one with 10,000, even if your group has only 10 people.\nCorn SyrupA group of 10 people within a large organization is a kind of fake\ntribe.  The number of people you interact with is about right.  But\nsomething is missing: individual initiative.  Tribes of hunter-gatherers\nhave much more freedom.  The leaders have a little more power than other\nmembers of the tribe, but they don't generally tell them what to\ndo and when the way a boss can.It's not your boss's fault.  The rea"}, {"role": "user", "content": "l problem is that in the group\nabove you in the hierarchy, your entire group is one virtual person.\nYour boss is just the way that constraint is imparted to you.So working in a group of 10 people within a large organization feels\nboth right and wrong at the same time.   On the surface it feels\nlike the kind of group you're meant to work in, but something major\nis missing.  A job at a big company is like high fructose corn\nsyrup: it has some of the qualities of things you're meant to like,\nbut is disastrously lacking in others.Indeed, food is an excellent metaphor to explain what's wrong with\nthe usual sort of job.For example, working for a big company is the default thing to do,\nat least for programmers.  How bad could it be?  Well, food shows\nthat pretty clearly.  If you were dropped at a random point in\nAmerica today, nearly all the food around you would be bad for you.\nHumans were not designed to eat white flour, refined sugar, high\nfructose corn syrup, and hydrogenated vegetable oil.  And yet if\nyou analyzed the contents of the average grocery store you'd probably\nfind these four ingredients accounted for most of the calories.\n\"Normal\" food is terribly bad for you.  The only people who eat\nwhat humans were actually designed to eat are a few Birkenstock-wearing\nweirdos in Berkeley.If \"normal\" food is so bad for us, why is it so common?  There are\ntwo main reasons. One is that it has more immediate appeal.  You\nmay feel lousy an hour after eating that pizza, but eating the first\ncouple bites feels great.  The other is economies of scale.\nProducing junk food scales; producing fresh vegetables doesn't.\nWhich means (a) junk food can be very cheap, and (b) it's worth\nspending a lot to market it.If people have to choose between something that's cheap, heavily\nmarketed, and appealing in the short term, and something that's\nexpensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, which do you\nthink most will choose?It's the same with work.  The average MIT graduate wants to work\nat Google or Microsoft, because it's a recognized brand, it's safe,\nand they'll get paid a good salary right away.  It's the job\nequivalent of the pizza they had for lunch.  The drawbacks will\nonly become apparent later, and then only in a vague sense of\nmalaise.And founders and early employees of startups, meanwhile, are like\nthe Birkenstock-wearing weirdos of Berkeley:  though a tiny minority\nof the population, they're the ones living as humans are meant to.\nIn an artificial world, only extremists live naturally.\nProgrammersThe restrictiveness of big company jobs is particularly hard on\nprogrammers, because the essence of programming is to build new\nthings.  Sales people make much the same pitches every day; support\npeople answer much the same questions; but once you've written a\npiece of code you don't need to write it again.  So a programmer\nworking as programmers are meant to is always making new things.\nAnd when you're part of an organization whose structure gives each\nperson freedom in inverse proportion to the size of the tree, you're\ngoing to face resistance when you do something new.This seems an inevitable consequence of bigness.  It's true even\nin the smartest companies.  I was talking recently to a founder who\nconsidered starting a startup right out of college, but went to\nwork for Google instead because he thought he'd learn more there.\nHe didn't learn as much as he expected.  Programmers learn by doing,\nand most of the things he wanted to do, he couldn't\u2014sometimes\nbecause the company wouldn't let him, but often because the company's\ncode wouldn't let him.  Between the drag of legacy code, the overhead\nof doing development in such a large organization, and the restrictions\nimposed by interfaces owned by other groups, he could only try a\nfraction of the things he would have liked to.  He said he has\nlearned much more in his own startup, despite the fact that he has\nto do all the company's errands as well as programming, because at\nleast when he's programming he can do whatever he wants.An obstacle downstream propagates upstream.  If you're not allowed\nto implement new ideas, you stop having them.  And vice versa: when\nyou can do whatever you want, you have more ideas about what to do.\nSo work"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ing for yourself makes your brain more powerful in the same\nway a low-restriction exhaust system makes an engine more powerful.Working for yourself doesn't have to mean starting a startup, of\ncourse.  But a programmer deciding between a regular job at a big\ncompany and their own startup is probably going to learn more doing\nthe startup.You can adjust the amount of freedom you get by scaling the size\nof company you work for.  If you start the company, you'll have the\nmost freedom.  If you become one of the first 10 employees you'll\nhave almost as much freedom as the founders.  Even a company with\n100 people will feel different from one with 1000.Working for a small company doesn't ensure freedom.  The tree\nstructure of large organizations sets an upper bound on freedom,\nnot a lower bound.  The head of a small company may still choose\nto be a tyrant.  The point is that a large organization is compelled\nby its structure to be one.\nConsequencesThat has real consequences for both organizations and individuals.\nOne is that companies will inevitably slow down as they grow larger,\nno matter how hard they try to keep their startup mojo.  It's a\nconsequence of the tree structure that every large organization is\nforced to adopt.Or rather, a large organization could only avoid slowing down if\nthey avoided tree structure.  And since human nature limits the\nsize of group that can work together, the only way I can imagine\nfor larger groups to avoid tree structure would be to have no\nstructure: to have each group actually be independent, and to work\ntogether the way components of a market economy do.That might be worth exploring.  I suspect there are already some\nhighly partitionable businesses that lean this way.  But I don't\nknow any technology companies that have done it.There is one thing companies can do short of structuring themselves\nas sponges:  they can stay small.  If I'm right, then it really\npays to keep a company as small as it can be at every stage.\nParticularly a technology company.  Which means it's doubly important\nto hire the best people.  Mediocre hires hurt you twice: they get\nless done, but they also make you big, because you need more of\nthem to solve a given problem.For individuals the upshot is the same: aim small.  It will always\nsuck to work for large organizations, and the larger the organization,\nthe more it will suck.In an essay I wrote a couple years ago \nI advised graduating seniors\nto work for a couple years for another company before starting their\nown.  I'd modify that now.  Work for another company if you want\nto, but only for a small one, and if you want to start your own\nstartup, go ahead.The reason I suggested college graduates not start startups immediately\nwas that I felt most would fail.  And they will.  But ambitious\nprogrammers are better off doing their own thing and failing than\ngoing to work at a big company.  Certainly they'll learn more.  They\nmight even be better off financially.  A lot of people in their\nearly twenties get into debt, because their expenses grow even\nfaster than the salary that seemed so high when they left school.\nAt least if you start a startup and fail your net worth will be\nzero rather than negative.  \n[3]We've now funded so many different types of founders that we have\nenough data to see patterns, and there seems to be no benefit from\nworking for a big company.  The people who've worked for a few years\ndo seem better than the ones straight out of college, but only\nbecause they're that much older.The people who come to us from big companies often seem kind of\nconservative.  It's hard to say how much is because big companies\nmade them that way, and how much is the natural conservatism that\nmade them work for the big companies in the first place.  But\ncertainly a large part of it is learned.  I know because I've seen\nit burn off.Having seen that happen so many times is one of the things that\nconvinces me that working for oneself, or at least for a small\ngroup, is the natural way for programmers to live.  Founders arriving\nat Y Combinator often have the downtrodden air of refugees.  Three\nmonths later they're transformed: they have so much more \nconfidence\nthat they seem as if they've grown several inches taller. \n[4]\nS"}, {"role": "user", "content": "trange as this sounds, they seem both more worried and happier at the same\ntime.  Which is exactly how I'd describe the way lions seem in the\nwild.Watching employees get transformed into founders makes it clear\nthat the difference between the two is due mostly to environment\u2014and\nin particular that the environment in big companies is toxic to\nprogrammers.   In the first couple weeks of working on their own\nstartup they seem to come to life, because finally they're working\nthe way people are meant to.Notes[1]\nWhen I talk about humans being meant or designed to live a\ncertain way, I mean by evolution.[2]\nIt's not only the leaves who suffer.  The constraint propagates\nup as well as down.  So managers are constrained too; instead of\njust doing things, they have to act through subordinates.[3]\nDo not finance your startup with credit cards.  Financing a\nstartup with debt is usually a stupid move, and credit card debt\nstupidest of all.  Credit card debt is a bad idea, period.  It is\na trap set by evil companies for the desperate and the foolish.[4]\nThe founders we fund used to be younger (initially we encouraged\nundergrads to apply), and the first couple times I saw this I used\nto wonder if they were actually getting physically taller.Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Ross Boucher, Aaron Iba, Abby\nKirigin, Ivan Kirigin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for\nreading drafts of this.April 2004To the popular press, \"hacker\" means someone who breaks\ninto computers.  Among programmers it means a good programmer.\nBut the two meanings are connected.  To programmers,\n\"hacker\" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone\nwho can make a computer do what he wants\u2014whether the computer\nwants to or not.To add to the confusion, the noun \"hack\" also has two senses.  It can\nbe either a compliment or an insult.  It's called a hack when\nyou do something in an ugly way.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n  But when you do something\nso clever that you somehow beat the system, that's also\ncalled a hack.  The word is used more often in the former than\nthe latter sense, probably because ugly solutions are more\ncommon than brilliant ones.Believe it or not, the two senses of \"hack\" are also\nconnected.  Ugly and imaginative solutions have something in\ncommon: they both break the rules.  And there is a gradual\ncontinuum between rule breaking that's merely ugly (using\nduct tape to attach something to your bike) and rule breaking\nthat is brilliantly imaginative (discarding Euclidean space).Hacking predates computers.  When he\nwas working on the Manhattan Project, Richard Feynman used to\namuse himself by breaking into safes containing secret documents.\nThis tradition continues today.\nWhen we were in grad school, a hacker friend of mine who spent too much\ntime around MIT had\nhis own lock picking kit.\n(He now runs a hedge fund, a not unrelated enterprise.)It is sometimes hard to explain to authorities why one would\nwant to do such things.\nAnother friend of mine once got in trouble with the government for\nbreaking into computers.  This had only recently been declared\na crime, and the FBI found that their usual investigative\ntechnique didn't work.  Police investigation apparently begins with\na motive.  The usual motives are few: drugs, money, sex,\nrevenge.  Intellectual curiosity was not one of the motives on\nthe FBI's list.  Indeed, the whole concept seemed foreign to\nthem.Those in authority tend to be annoyed by hackers'\ngeneral attitude of disobedience.  But that disobedience is\na byproduct of the qualities that make them good programmers.\nThey may laugh at the CEO when he talks in generic corporate\nnewspeech, but they also laugh at someone who tells them\na certain problem can't be solved.\nSuppress one, and you suppress the other.This attitude is sometimes affected.  Sometimes young programmers\nnotice the eccentricities of eminent hackers and decide to\nadopt some of their own in order to seem smarter.\nThe fake version is not merely\nannoying; the prickly attitude of these posers\ncan actually slow the process of innovation.But even factoring in their annoying eccentricities,\nthe disobedient attitude of hackers is a net win.  I wish its\nadvantages "}, {"role": "user", "content": "were better understood.For example, I suspect people in Hollywood are\nsimply mystified by\nhackers' attitudes toward copyrights.  They are a perennial\ntopic of heated discussion on Slashdot.\nBut why should people who program computers\nbe so concerned about copyrights, of all things?Partly because some companies use mechanisms to prevent\ncopying.  Show any hacker a lock and his first thought is\nhow to pick it.  But there is a deeper reason that\nhackers are alarmed by measures like copyrights and patents.\nThey see increasingly aggressive measures to protect\n\"intellectual property\"\nas a threat to the intellectual\nfreedom they need to do their job.\nAnd they are right.It is by poking about inside current technology that\nhackers get ideas for the next generation.  No thanks,\nintellectual homeowners may say, we don't need any\noutside help.  But they're wrong.\nThe next generation of computer technology has\noften\u2014perhaps more often than not\u2014been developed by outsiders.In 1977 there was no doubt some group within IBM developing\nwhat they expected to be\nthe next generation of business computer.  They were mistaken.\nThe next generation of business computer was\nbeing developed on entirely different lines by two long-haired\nguys called Steve in a garage in Los Altos.  At about the\nsame time, the powers that be\nwere cooperating to develop the\nofficial next generation operating system, Multics.\nBut two guys who thought Multics excessively complex went off\nand wrote their own.  They gave it a name that\nwas a joking reference to Multics: Unix.The latest intellectual property laws impose\nunprecedented restrictions on the sort of poking around that\nleads to new ideas. In the past, a competitor might use patents\nto prevent you from selling a copy of something they\nmade, but they couldn't prevent you from\ntaking one apart to see how it worked.   The latest\nlaws make this a crime.  How are we\nto develop new technology if we can't study current\ntechnology to figure out how to improve it?Ironically, hackers have brought this on themselves.\nComputers are responsible for the problem.  The control systems\ninside machines used to be physical: gears and levers and cams.\nIncreasingly, the brains (and thus the value) of products is\nin software. And by this I mean software in the general sense:\ni.e. data.  A song on an LP is physically stamped into the\nplastic.  A song on an iPod's disk is merely stored on it.Data is by definition easy to copy.  And the Internet\nmakes copies easy to distribute.  So it is no wonder\ncompanies are afraid.  But, as so often happens, fear has\nclouded their judgement.  The government has responded\nwith draconian laws to protect intellectual property.\nThey probably mean well. But\nthey may not realize that such laws will do more harm\nthan good.Why are programmers so violently opposed to these laws?\nIf I were a legislator, I'd be interested in this\nmystery\u2014for the same reason that, if I were a farmer and suddenly\nheard a lot of squawking coming from my hen house one night,\nI'd want to go out and investigate.  Hackers are not stupid,\nand unanimity is very rare in this world.\nSo if they're all squawking,   \nperhaps there is something amiss.Could it be that such laws, though intended to protect America,\nwill actually harm it?  Think about it.  There is something\nvery American about Feynman breaking into safes during\nthe Manhattan Project.  It's hard to imagine the authorities\nhaving a sense of humor about such things over\nin Germany at that time.  Maybe it's not a coincidence.Hackers are unruly.  That is the essence of hacking.  And it\nis also the essence of Americanness.  It is no accident\nthat Silicon Valley\nis in America, and not France, or Germany,\nor England, or Japan. In those countries, people color inside\nthe lines.I lived for a while in Florence.  But after I'd been there\na few months I realized that what I'd been unconsciously hoping\nto find there was back in the place I'd just left.\nThe reason Florence is famous is that in 1450, it was New York.\nIn 1450 it was filled with the kind of turbulent and ambitious\npeople you find now in America.  (So I went back to America.)It is greatly to America's advantage that it is\na congenial atmosphere for the right sort of unruliness\u2014t"}, {"role": "user", "content": "hat\nit is a home not just for the smart, but for smart-alecks.\nAnd hackers are invariably smart-alecks.  If we had a national\nholiday, it would be April 1st.  It says a great deal about\nour work that we use the same word for a brilliant or a\nhorribly cheesy solution.   When we cook one up we're not\nalways 100% sure which kind it is.  But as long as it has\nthe right sort of wrongness, that's a promising sign.\nIt's odd that people\nthink of programming as precise and methodical.  Computers\nare precise and methodical.  Hacking is something you do\nwith a gleeful laugh.In our world some of the most characteristic solutions\nare not far removed from practical\njokes.  IBM was no doubt rather surprised by the consequences\nof the licensing deal for DOS, just as the hypothetical\n\"adversary\" must be when Michael Rabin solves a problem by\nredefining it as one that's easier to solve.Smart-alecks have to develop a keen sense of how much they\ncan get away with.  And lately hackers \nhave sensed a change\nin the atmosphere.\nLately hackerliness seems rather frowned upon.To hackers the recent contraction in civil liberties seems\nespecially ominous.  That must also mystify outsiders. \nWhy should we care especially about civil\nliberties?  Why programmers, more than\ndentists or salesmen or landscapers?Let me put the case in terms a government official would appreciate.\nCivil liberties are not just an ornament, or a quaint\nAmerican tradition.  Civil liberties make countries rich.\nIf you made a graph of\nGNP per capita vs. civil liberties, you'd notice a definite\ntrend.  Could civil liberties really be a cause, rather\nthan just an effect?  I think so.  I think a society in which\npeople can do and say what they want will also tend to\nbe one in which the most efficient solutions win, rather than\nthose sponsored by the most influential people.\nAuthoritarian countries become corrupt;\ncorrupt countries become poor; and poor countries are weak. \nIt seems to me there is\na Laffer curve for government power, just as for\ntax revenues.  At least, it seems likely enough that it\nwould be stupid to try the experiment and find out.  Unlike\nhigh tax rates, you can't repeal totalitarianism if it\nturns out to be a mistake.This is why hackers worry.  The government spying on people doesn't\nliterally make programmers write worse code.  It just leads\neventually to a world in which bad ideas win.  And because\nthis is so important to hackers, they're especially sensitive\nto it.  They can sense totalitarianism approaching from a\ndistance, as animals can sense an approaching  \nthunderstorm.It would be ironic if, as hackers fear, recent measures\nintended to protect national security and intellectual property\nturned out to be a missile aimed right at what makes   \nAmerica successful.  But it would not be the first time that\nmeasures taken in an atmosphere of panic had\nthe opposite of the intended effect.There is such a thing as Americanness.\nThere's nothing like living abroad to teach you that.   \nAnd if you want to know whether something will nurture or squash\nthis quality, it would be hard to find a better focus\ngroup than hackers, because they come closest of any group\nI know to embodying it.  Closer, probably,  than\nthe men running our government,\nwho for all their talk of patriotism\nremind me more of Richelieu or Mazarin\nthan Thomas Jefferson or George Washington.When you read what the founding fathers had to say for\nthemselves, they sound more like hackers.\n\"The spirit of resistance to government,\"\nJefferson wrote, \"is so valuable on certain occasions, that I wish\nit always to be kept alive.\"Imagine an American president saying that today.\nLike the remarks of an outspoken old grandmother, the sayings of\nthe founding fathers have embarrassed generations of\ntheir less confident successors.  They remind us where we come from.\nThey remind us that it is the people who break rules that are\nthe source of America's wealth and power.Those in a position to impose rules naturally want them to be\nobeyed.  But be careful what you ask for. You might get it.Thanks to Ken Anderson, Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Giffin, \nSarah Harlin,  Shiro Kawai, Jessica Livingston, Matz, \nJackie McDonough, Robert Morris, Eric Raymond, Guido van Rossum,\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "David Weinberger, and\nSteven Wolfram for reading drafts of this essay.\n(The image shows Steves Jobs and Wozniak \nwith a \"blue box.\"\nPhoto by Margret Wozniak.

Chan\nSchool of Public Health.Noora is so effective that even if you measure their costs in the\nmost conservative way, by dividing their entire budget by the number\nof lives saved, the cost of saving a life is the lowest I've seen.\n$1,235.For this NFT, they're going to issue a public report tracking how\nthis specific tranche of money is spent, and estimating the number\nof lives saved as a result.NFTs are a new territory, and this way of using them is especially\nnew, but I'm excited about its potential. And I'm excited to see\nwhat happens with this particular auction, because unlike an NFT\nrepresenting something that has already happened,\nthis NFT gets better as the price gets higher.The reserve price was about $2.5 million, because that's what it\ntakes for the name to be accurate: that's what it costs to save\n2000 lives. But the higher the price of this NFT goes, the more\nlives will be saved. What a sentence to be able to write.February 2020What should an essay be? Many people would say persuasive. That's\nwhat a lot of us were taught essays should be. But I think we can\naim for something more ambitious: that an essay should be useful.To start with, that means it should be correct. But it's not enough\nmerely to be correct. It's easy to make a statement correct by\nmaking it vague. That's a common flaw in academic writing, for\nexample. If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go\nwrong by saying that the issue is a complex one, that there are\nmany factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too\nsimplistic a view of it, and so on.Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader nothing.\nUseful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made\nwithout becoming false.For example, it's more useful to say that Pike's Peak is near the\nmiddle of Colorado than merely somewhere in Colorado. But if I say\nit's in the exact middle of Colorado, I've now gone too far, because\nit's a bit east of the middle.Precision and correctness are like opposing forces. It's easy to\nsatisfy one if you ignore the other. The converse of vaporous\nacademic writing is the bold, but false, rhetoric of demagogues.\nUseful writing is bold, but true.It's also two other things: it tells people something important,\nand that at least some of them didn't already know.Telling people something they didn't know doesn't always mean\nsurprising them. Sometimes it means telling them something they\nknew unconsciously but had never put into words. In fact those may\nbe the more valuable insights, because they tend to be more\nfundamental.Let's put them all together. Useful writing tells people something\ntrue and important that they didn't already know, and tells them\nas unequivocally as possible.Notice these are all a matter of degree. For example, you can't\nexpect an idea to be novel to everyone. Any insight that you have\nwill probably have already been had by at least one of the world's\n7 billion people. But it's sufficient if an idea is novel to a lot\nof readers.Ditto for correctness, importance, and strength. In effect the four\ncomponents are like numbers you can multiply together to get a score\nfor usefulness. Which I realize is almost awkwardly reductive, but\nnonetheless true._____\nHow can you ensur"}, {"role": "user", "content": "e that the things you say are true and novel and\nimportant? Believe it or not, there is a trick for doing this. I\nlearned it from my friend Robert Morris, who has a horror of saying\nanything dumb. His trick is not to say anything unless he's sure\nit's worth hearing. This makes it hard to get opinions out of him,\nbut when you do, they're usually right.Translated into essay writing, what this means is that if you write\na bad sentence, you don't publish it. You delete it and try again.\nOften you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes\na whole essay.You can't ensure that every idea you have is good, but you can\nensure that every one you publish is, by simply not publishing the\nones that aren't.In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered\nbad. When some hypothesis you're exploring gets inconclusive results,\nyou're supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay\nwriting, publication bias is the way to go.My strategy is loose, then tight. I write the first draft of an\nessay fast, trying out all kinds of ideas. Then I spend days rewriting\nit very carefully.I've never tried to count how many times I proofread essays, but\nI'm sure there are sentences I've read 100 times before publishing\nthem. When I proofread an essay, there are usually passages that\nstick out in an annoying way, sometimes because they're clumsily\nwritten, and sometimes because I'm not sure they're true. The\nannoyance starts out unconscious, but after the tenth reading or\nso I'm saying \"Ugh, that part\" each time I hit it. They become like\nbriars that catch your sleeve as you walk past. Usually I won't\npublish an essay till they're all gone \u0097 till I can read through\nthe whole thing without the feeling of anything catching.I'll sometimes let through a sentence that seems clumsy, if I can't\nthink of a way to rephrase it, but I will never knowingly let through\none that doesn't seem correct. You never have to. If a sentence\ndoesn't seem right, all you have to do is ask why it doesn't, and\nyou've usually got the replacement right there in your head.This is where essayists have an advantage over journalists. You\ndon't have a deadline. You can work for as long on an essay as you\nneed to get it right. You don't have to publish the essay at all,\nif you can't get it right. Mistakes seem to lose courage in the\nface of an enemy with unlimited resources. Or that's what it feels\nlike. What's really going on is that you have different expectations\nfor yourself. You're like a parent saying to a child \"we can sit\nhere all night till you eat your vegetables.\" Except you're the\nchild too.I'm not saying no mistake gets through. For example, I added condition\n(c) in \"A Way to Detect Bias\" \nafter readers pointed out that I'd\nomitted it. But in practice you can catch nearly all of them.There's a trick for getting importance too. It's like the trick I\nsuggest to young founders for getting startup ideas: to make something\nyou yourself want. You can use yourself as a proxy for the reader.\nThe reader is not completely unlike you, so if you write about\ntopics that seem important to you, they'll probably seem important\nto a significant number of readers as well.Importance has two factors. It's the number of people something\nmatters to, times how much it matters to them. Which means of course\nthat it's not a rectangle, but a sort of ragged comb, like a Riemann\nsum.The way to get novelty is to write about topics you've thought about\na lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this\ndepartment too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who've\nthought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a\nsignificant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and\nimportance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you\nwill. If you don't learn anything from writing an essay, don't\npublish it.You need humility to measure novelty, because acknowledging the\nnovelty of an idea means acknowledging your previous ignorance of\nit. Confidence and humility are often seen as opposites, but in\nthis case, as in many others, confidence helps you to be humble.\nIf you know you're an expert on some topic, you can freely admit\nwhen you learn something you didn't know, because you can"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?
